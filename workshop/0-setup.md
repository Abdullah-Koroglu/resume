# Setup

As you might expect, the first step to getting started with any new technology is obtaining a couple of tools. While it is possible to create HTML and CSS with any text editor, using a code editor will offer features to make your life easier.

We'll be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), a free, open source editor, for this workshop. We'll also add the [CodeSwing](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=codespaces-Contrib.codeswing) extension, which allows us to make edits to our HTML/CSS and see the results immediately.

## Install Visual Studio Code

Let's start by installing Visual Studio Code.

1. Navigate to [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
1. Follow the instructions on the page to perform the installation
    1. For Windows or MacOS you will download and run the installer as you would with any other software
    1. For Linux, you will need to use the package manager for your distribution

## Install CodeSwing

Once Visual Studio Code is installed, we'll install CodeSwing. As mentioned before, CodeSwing is an extension which helps us create HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and see updates in realtime.

1. Open Visual Studio Code
1. Open the Extensions toolbar by selecting **View** > **Extensions**
1. In the **Search Extensions** textbox in the upper-right corner, type **CodeSwing**
1. Select **Install** for **CodeSwing**

The extension will be installed.

## Summary and next step

Congratulations! You have the tools you need to begin creating HTML/CSS pages. Next, let's [create our first page](./1-create-html.md).
